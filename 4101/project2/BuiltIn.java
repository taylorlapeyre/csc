// BuiltIn.java -- the data structure for function closures

// Class BuiltIn is used for representing the value of built-in functions
// such as +.  Populate the initial environment with
// (name, new BuiltIn(name)) pairs.

// The object-oriented style for implementing built-in functions would be
// to include the Java methods for implementing a Scheme built-in in the
// BuiltIn object.  This could be done by writing one subclass of class
// BuiltIn for each built-in function and implementing the method apply
// appropriately.  This requires a large number of classes, though.
// Another alternative is to program BuiltIn.apply() in a functional
// style by writing a large if-then-else chain that tests the name of
// of the function symbol.

    private Node symbol;

    public BuiltIn(Node s)		{ symbol = s; }

	symbol.print(n+3);

    // to report an error.  It should be overwritten only in classes
    // BuiltIn and Closure.
